## âœ¨ Welcome! I'm starting my developer journal today.

### ðŸ”® Looking Ahead
In the future, someone might stumble upon this journal. So, let's begin with a brief introduction about myself.

#### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
Hello! My name is Hashir. I am a full-time software developer currently working at UST with over 2.8 years of experience. After completing my diploma in Computer Engineering, I took some time to explore various technologies such as Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Blockchain. Among these, I found a particular interest in Blockchain and decided to specialize in that area.

I joined the ABCD program by the ICT Academy of Kerala & K-DISC, which is a great initiative for accelerated blockchain competency development. As part of this program, I completed the initial step, a comprehensive full-stack development course in MEAN stack by the ICT Academy of Kerala. Unfortunately, due to some unknown reasons, the upcoming blockchain courses were delayed.

In the meantime, I started preparing for interviews and eventually secured my current role as a software developer at UST.

#### ðŸš€ Future Plans
Currently, I am in the process of serving my notice period. During this time, I plan to take a break to upskill myself and secure a better position where I can contribute more significantly and tackle more challenging problems.
