- Hi There,
- Today is a saturday. It's 1'O clock here in noon.
- Need to go through the last days coding solutions and notes for a quick recap.
- There are a lot more coding problems that I need to solve and master, will move to them after that.
- Found a new stuff in JS called  object property shorthand.
- While optimising the solution that I wrote to find out the numbers of vowles in a string, came to know about regex, spent some time on understanding it well.
- Wrote a note on regex in JS.
