### Title: Added Todo App with DOM Manipulation

#### Description:
- Created a simple Todo application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice DOM manipulation.
- Implemented functionality to add new todos with title and description.
- Added buttons to mark todos as done, edit todo details, and remove todos.
- Implemented event handlers for button clicks to perform corresponding actions such as marking as done, editing, and removing todos.
- Added functionality to toggle between marking a todo as done and removing it.
- Implemented editing functionality to update todo title and description.
- Utilized DOM methods such as getElementById, createElement, innerHTML, appendChild, removeChild, setAttribute, and style properties for DOM manipulation.
- Used contenteditable attribute to make todo title and description editable upon clicking the edit button.
- Styled the application with basic CSS for visual appeal and readability.
- Tested the application to ensure proper functionality and responsiveness.
- Added comments to the JavaScript code for clarity and maintainability.

### Refactor: Use Event Delegation for Improved Performance

Implemented event delegation for handling todo actions such as marking as done, editing, and removing todos. Instead of attaching event handlers directly to each button, events are now delegated to higher-level elements such as the dispTodos container. This reduces the number of event listeners and improves performance, especially with a large number of todos. Additionally, modified the 'Add Todo' button event handling to use event delegation for consistency.

### Refactor: JavaScript code for improved efficiency and readability

Refractored the JavaScript code in todo.js to enhance performance and maintainability. Several changes have been made to streamline the code and reduce redundancy. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Cached frequently accessed DOM elements:
   - Cached references to frequently accessed DOM elements such as input fields, todo container, and submit button at the beginning of the script. This avoids repeated querying of the DOM, leading to improved performance.

2. Extracted repetitive code into functions:
   - Extracted repetitive code blocks into separate functions to eliminate duplication and improve code readability. Functions such as `toggleContentEditable`, `toggleButtonText`, `toggleTextDecoration`, and `toggleButtonClass` are introduced to handle common operations on todo items.

3. Improved function and variable names:
   - Renamed functions and variables to enhance clarity and maintainability. Function names now accurately reflect their purpose, making it easier to understand their functionality. Variable names are more descriptive, aiding in code comprehension.

4. Adjusted function structures:
   - Reorganized the structure of functions to improve consistency and readability. Function declarations are now grouped logically, and parameters are named appropriately for better understanding.

5. Added comments for clarity:
   - Added comments throughout the code to provide context and explanation where necessary. Comments clarify the purpose of functions, variables, and code blocks, aiding future developers in understanding the codebase.

These changes collectively enhance the efficiency, readability, and maintainability of the JavaScript codebase, making it easier to manage and extend in the future.

### Add styling to improve visual appearance of todo items

This commit enhances the visual appearance of todo items in the todo app by adding CSS styles for better readability and user experience. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. Updated the CSS to style todo items:
   - Added styles for the `.todo-item` class to ensure proper layout and spacing of todo items. The flex-direction property is set to column to stack the children elements vertically.
   - Added styles for the `.todo-title` class to make the todo title bold.
   - Added styles for the `.todo-description` class to make the todo description italic.

2. Modified the `createTodoElement()` function:
   - Updated the function to wrap the todo title and description in elements with appropriate classes (`todo-title` and `todo-description` respectively).
   - Added CSS classes to the todo title and description elements to apply the corresponding styles.

These styling changes improve the visual hierarchy and readability of todo items, making it easier for users to distinguish between todo titles and descriptions. The todo app now provides a more polished and user-friendly interface.
