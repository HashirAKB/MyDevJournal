- Going to complete hard todo application.
- Got the logical solution while I was in bathroom.

# Work Log - March 7, 2024

## Refactor: Modularize Todo app code
- Extracted logger functionality into a separate module for better organization and reusability.
- Separated data access operations into their own module to encapsulate file handling logic.
- Moved route handlers into a dedicated module for improved code structure and maintainability.
- Created an entry point file to configure routes and start the server.
- Each module now has a single responsibility, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.

## Refactor: Organize log files into a "logs" directory
- Updated the logger module to store log files in a "logs" directory for better organization.
- Added logic to create the directory if it doesn't exist.
- Modified file paths in Winston transports to prepend "./logs/", ensuring that log files are stored within the designated folder.

## Refactor API error handling and logging in todoFile.js
- Enhanced error handling mechanism in the todoFile.js module.
- Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for transient errors encountered during data retrieval from the file system.
- Added a new function `getFallbackData()` to provide alternative data or implement a fallback mechanism in case of critical errors.
- Updated routes to utilize the enhanced error handling mechanism by replacing calls to `getDataFromFile()` with `getDataFromFileWithRetry()`.
- These improvements enhance the robustness and resilience of the application, ensuring smoother operation even in the face of transient errors.

## feat: Implement Winston logging for improved error handling and debugging
- Introduced Winston, a logging library for Node.js, to the todo app.
- Configured Winston to log messages to files ('error.log' for errors and 'combined.log' for all messages) and to the console during development.
- Determined and logged the environment using Winston to provide visibility into the current environment.
- Enhanced the application's error handling capabilities and facilitated debugging by providing comprehensive logging functionality.

## feat: Implement file-based storage for todo items
- Introduced functionality to store todo items in a file named "todos.json".
- Updated route handlers to utilize file-based storage for todo items.
- Ensured backward compatibility by handling cases where the file does not exist initially.
- Enhanced user experience by ensuring that todo items are retained even after server restarts.
