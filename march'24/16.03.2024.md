# Work Log - March 16, 2024

- Wake-up at 5.30 am.
- Done workout + 6 km cycling.

- ## Completed week 3 sessions of 0-100x cohort, which covered:

    ### Middlewares, Global Catches & Zod
    - **Understanding Middlewares**: Exploring middlewares in JavaScript, their importance in request handling, and their implementation to streamline code. Also, discussing associated concepts like `next()` keyword, the difference between `res.send()` and `res.json()`, and the importance of `app.use(express.json())`.
    - **Global Catches**: The importance of global error handling and various input validation techniques, including the use of the Zod library for schema validation.

    ### Authentication & Databases
    - **fetch() Method**: Explaining the `fetch()` method for making network requests in JavaScript and its asynchronous concepts such as callbacks, promises, and async/await.
    - **Authentication**: Covered authentication methods such as hashing, encryption, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), along with practical implementation examples. Also, discussingcovered the importance of local storage in authentication and using authorization headers in Node.js with Axios.
    - **Databases**: Got insights into various database types, with a focus on MongoDB. This includes setting up a free instance, connecting the backend to the database, and understanding database basics.

    ### Fetch() vs Axios()
    - **Fetch API vs Axios**: Comparing the features, syntax, and use cases of Fetch API and Axios for making HTTP requests.

    ## Conclusion
    This week sessions gave a comprehensive understanding of middleware implementation, error handling, input validation, authentication methods, database types, and asynchronous programming concepts essential for web development tasks.

    Along with this, covered:
    - Recap session on middlewares (expressJS) and related assignments.
    - Recap session on JWT & Authentication and related assignments.
