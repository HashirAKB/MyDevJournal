# Work Log - March 14, 2024

- Early rise.
- Workout Done.
- Started around 9.30 am.
- Need to complete middleware assignments.

##### Implemented middleware for request counting, rate limiting, and error handling in the 'week-3/01-middlewares' directory:

- Added `countRequests` middleware to track the number of incoming requests.
- Implemented `requestLimiter` middleware to limit requests per user and handle rate limiting.
- Added global error handling middleware to increment error count on application errors.
