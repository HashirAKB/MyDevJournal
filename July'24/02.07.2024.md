- Completed week 19.0.1 of 100xDevs cohort: Understood CSR, SSR, and SSG.   
- Continued on Never-Ending-Todo:
    - Improved the structure of the components for better readability and maintainability.
    - Introduced middleware to count the number of requests made. This will help in monitoring the application usage.
    - Implemented a new route to fetch the total requests count information, providing insight into the usage metrics.
    - Added a `requestLimiter` middleware to restrict the number of requests per user. This middleware ensures that a user can only make 3 requests per second. It helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage of the application's resources.
    - Introduced a global error handler middleware to catch and manage errors occurring in the application, improving the overall robustness.
    - Added test cases for the `rateLimiter` middleware to ensure its functionality and reliability.
    - Deployed to render.
    - Published new release.
