## Work Log - July 18, 2024

- Worked on Lottery dApp as part of foundry 101 by cyfrin updraft.
    - Initialized the project using 'forge init'.
    - Created contract `raffle.sol`.
    - Initialized functions `enterRaffle` and `pickWinner`.
    - Declared immutable `entranceFee` variable, assigned value in constructor.
    - Made `enterRaffle` function payable for users to send entrance fee.
    - Implemented getter function for entrance fee.
    - Reviewed Solidity style guide to follow best practices.
    - Created a checklist according to the style guide for the smart contract.
    - Decided to use custom errors instead of string error messages to save gas.
    - Placed custom errors inside the contract for best practice.
    - Named custom errors with prefix 'contractName__' for readability.
    - Used 's_' prefix for storage variables as a best practice.
    - Initialized a payable array of type address to store players.
    - Studied Solidity events for efficient gas log printing.
    - Implemented event emissions for storage changes.
    - Made `pickWinner` and `enterRaffle` functions external.
    - Learned about Chainlink VRF for random number logic.
    - Added storage variable `lastTimeStamp`, populated with `block.timestamp` via constructor.
    - Implemented time check between rounds.
    - Imported `Chainlink VRFBase2Plus` into raffle contract.
    - Added constructor variables for inherited contracts.
    - Studied abstract contracts and implemented necessary functions.
    - Used random number to select a winner from players array by modding with array length.
    - Implemented lottery contract state to act as an entry gate/barrier.
    - State changes from 'open' to 'calculating' during winner selection.
    - Reset timer and players array after winner selection.
    - Reviewed Chainlink automation documentation for decentralized automation in lottery smart contract.
