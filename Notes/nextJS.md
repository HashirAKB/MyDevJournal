Study Note: Next.js

- Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR), enhancing SEO and user experience.
- It addresses issues like SEO optimization for JavaScript-heavy applications, where search engine bots struggle to index dynamic content.
- Next.js offers solutions like Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), which pre-render pages at build time or request time, improving performance and SEO.
- The 'Waterfalling' problem in traditional React applications, where multiple requests are made to fetch data, is solved by Next.js through features like Code Splitting and Lazy Loading.
- Next.js supports Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR), allowing for updating static pages without rebuilding the entire site.
- It offers automatic optimizations for performance, such as image optimization, code splitting, and more.
- Setting up a Next.js project involves bootstrapping, creating the project file structure, initial setup, configuring import aliases, and running the development server.
- Routing in Next.js is flexible and intuitive, with options for nesting routes and using parenthesized folders.
- Next.js allows for server-side rendering of layouts, enabling consistent layouts across pages and improving performance.
- It also supports nested layouts and merging routes, providing flexibility in structuring applications.
- Client and server components in Next.js allow for optimal use of server-side rendering and client-side interactivity.
