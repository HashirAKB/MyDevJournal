## Work Log - June 12, 2024

- Started week 14.
- Hello world into nextJS.

- Here's a summary of the development work I've done:

1. **Optimized Client-Side Rendering**: Introduced a more efficient way to handle client-side rendering, specifically for handling click events on buttons. This involved moving the button component logic into a separate component (`SignInButtonComponent`) and utilizing it within the main sign-in component (`SignInComponent`). This change was aimed at improving the structure and maintainability of the codebase.

2. **Implemented Backdoor Authentication Page**: Created a backdoor authentication page (`backdoor/page.tsx`) within the `(auth)` directory. This page includes a simple component (`BackDoorComponent`) that displays a message indicating the presence of a backdoor. This could be part of a testing or debugging feature.

3. **Refactored Sign-In and Sign-Up Pages**: Reworked the sign-in (`signin/page.tsx`) and sign-up (`signup/page.tsx`) pages to improve their structure and readability. This included moving components to a more organized directory structure and simplifying the overall layout.

4. **Introduced Persistent Banner Across Routes**: Implemented a persistent banner across certain routes, such as the sign-in and sign-up pages. This was achieved by modifying the layout components (`layout.tsx`) to include a banner div that displays promotional messages.

5. **Improved File-Based Routing Understanding**: Made several adjustments to better understand and implement file-based routing in Next.js. This involved renaming files and directories to adhere to a consistent naming convention and restructuring the project to reflect best practices for Next.js projects.

6. **Added New Components**: Developed new components such as `SignInComponent`, `SignUpComponent`, and `BackDoorComponent`. These components were designed to encapsulate specific functionalities related to signing in, signing up, and accessing a backdoor authentication route.

7. **Cleaned Up Default Landing Page**: Removed unnecessary code and simplified the default landing page (`layout.tsx`) to serve as a clean slate for further development.

These changes collectively aim to improve the structure, readability, and functionality of the application, making it easier to manage and extend in the future.
