## Work Log, Some Thoughts - April 18, 2024

I'm back to my complete productive coding setup today as I arrived at trivandrum. Kind of managed to spend few hours daily to code and continue the learning streak but it was not good as it supposed to be. Went to home as part of eid. One thing I realised is that you should stick to something if you went for something. Doing coding or spenting time on a festival time especially from home is not very good, I say, Couldn't able to give my complete attention  neither to coding or spending time with family although I was there for about two weeks. So change of plan! Do not take laptop to home, If you want to visit family do it properly by expperiencing all the essence of it. Aim like quality over quantity spend 2 nights, don't code. Come back and focus on building and learning stuff. Don't take both of them for granted.

- Completed hour 1 of week 6.2.
