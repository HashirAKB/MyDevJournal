- Completed sessions of week 7.

AtomFamily:
 - using to dynamically creating atoms.
 - Atoms work when you know something present is only once in the screen.
 - Suppose if we have a bunch of todos then we have to create a bunch of atoms for each todo component.
 - When we have to create an atom per item then we create and use something called atomFamily.
 - atomFamily lets you dynamically create multiple atoms.
 - Atom family is a function which returns a fn that gives you an atom for you.
