## Work Log - May 9, 2024

- Did skimmed through last few days learnings in the morning (week 7).
- Completed basic recoil stuff.
- Did coding for all of the basic recoil stuff except Asynchronous data queries.

Recoil Deep Dive (7.4):
- Basic recoil stuff, Atoms, selectors, Asynchronous data queries, useRecoilState, useRecoilValue, useSetRecoilState.
- Advanced recoil stuff: atomFamily, selectorFamily, useRecoilStateLoadable, useRecoilValueLoadable.

Atom: normally uses useState, incase of recoil we use as Atoms. It's an another way of storing variables.
